## Troubleshooting

### 12. I’m having trouble with voice search. What should I do?
If you're experiencing issues with voice search, ensure that your browser permissions are correctly set to allow microphone access. Voice search is supported on most modern browsers, but performance may vary. 
If you are using Firefox you might need to activate voice recognition from `about:config`. Type `about:config` to addres bar in Firefox, search for the `media.webspeech.recognition.enable` and 
`media.webspeech.recognition.force_enable` preferences and make sure they are set as true. For more information you can check this [document](https://wiki.mozilla.org/Web_Speech_API_-_Speech_Recognition).
If you continue to have problems please open an issue on [Artado Search repository](https://github.com/Artado-Project/artadosearch/issues) or open a discussion on [Artado Forum](https://forum.artado.xyz/).

### 13. Why isn’t my bang working?
If a bang isn’t working as expected, double-check that you’re using the correct keyword and that the website you’re targeting is supported. If the problem persists, it might be due to temporary issues with the target website or a typo in your search.
